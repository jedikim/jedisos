      "instructions": "Classify the user message intent into exactly one of the following categories:\n\n- complex: Use this for requests requiring deep analysis, comparative evaluations (e.g., comparing future AI models), economic outlooks, strategic reasoning, or mathematical projections/simulations (e.g., compound interest calculations).\n- question: Use this for straightforward factual lookups, real-time data retrieval (weather, current stock prices), or retrieval of personal/known data points.\n- skill_request: Use this when the user asks to fix/modify a tool OR when the user triggers a specific functional service or plugin-like feature, such as fetching the latest news headlines or performing a system action.\n- chat: Use this for social greetings, polite closures, or general conversational fillers that do not require data retrieval or analysis (e.g., \"Goodnight\").\n\nStrategy:\n1. Social vs. Functional: First, check if the message is a social greeting or \"small talk.\" If so, classify as 'chat'.\n2. Tool Invocation (Skill): If the user is asking for \"the news,\" a \"fix,\" or an action that requires a specific system capability/plugin to execute a task, classify as 'skill_request'.\n3. Static vs. Calculated: \n    - If the request asks for an existing data point (e.g., \"What is the price of X?\"), classify as 'question'.\n    - If the request requires projecting future values, evaluating which of two complex entities is \"better,\" or simulating a scenario, classify as 'complex'.\n4. Financial/Analytical Verbs: Parameters involving \"principal, rate, time\" or verbs like \"analyze,\" \"evaluate,\" and \"forecast\" signal 'complex'.\n\nDomain Specific Rules:\n- News requests (\"최신 뉴스 뭐 있어?\") must be classified as 'skill_request', as they trigger a specific information-gathering skill.\n- Comparisons between unreleased or high-level technologies (e.g., \"GPT-5 vs Gemini 3\") are 'complex'.",
