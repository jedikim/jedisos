    Extract 2-3 focused web search queries to find reference code and API docs for building the following tool. Each query should target a different aspect.

    User request: {request}

    Rules:
    - Query 1: Find a working code example (Python preferred)
    - Query 2: Find the specific API documentation or library for the core feature
    - Query 3 (optional): If there's a language/locale challenge (e.g., Korean input), search specifically for that
    - Each query should be concise (5-10 words)
    - Include "python" in at least one query
    - Include "free" or "no API key" if relevant

    Return a JSON array of query strings:
    ["query 1", "query 2", "query 3"]
